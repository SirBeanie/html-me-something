                      <h1>About me and comic books</h1>
                          <h2>When did I start collecting?</h2>
                              <p>I started collecting comic books when I was a little kid, sometime around 6 or 7
                              years old. It probably caught<br> my attentions so much, because me and my dad would
                              always go to comic book shows togather. I even<br> remember going to peoples houses
                              and looking through rooms full of comic books. I have been a collector ever since.
                              </p> 
                          <h2>What are my favorite books?</h2>
                              <p>Collecting books over the years I have acquired many favorites. The main book that
                              the main book that always<br> comes to mind is Amazing Fantasy 15, which is the 1st 
                              appearance of SpiderMan. My second favorite book<br> would be Incredible Hulk 181,
                              which is the 1st appearance of Wolverine. My third favorite book would be<br> Action
                              Comics 1, which would be the 1st appearance of Superman. 
                             </p>
                         <h2>How do you collect today?</h2>
                             <p>Today I am still collecting as much as before. I have a huge collection
                              with some pretty key comics from<br> the gold to copper ages. I am actually
                              hoping to build an online site I can use to trade comics and other 
                              collectables.
